title: "Full Stack Lisp release party"
---

Good news! Full Stack Lisp is now at a point where I feel comfortable sharing more of the process with you. Although I've written fairly little since my last update, I've managed to clarify a few things and now I have a much clearer idea of where this project is going. As of this blog post the book is officially out in early draft form and available online and for purchase from Leanpub. But before we get to that, let me give you a quick status update.

## Current Status

The book is currently 25% done, you can interpret that number as you wish. Here are some more details: each section of the book is in one of the following states(ordered by proximity to completion):

* To be written
* Early draft
* Late draft
* Needs editing
* Done

The current status of book is as follows

* Frontmatter (Needs editing)
* Part I
  * Chapter 1: Roswell (Late Draft)
  * Chapter 2: Lisp libraries (Early draft)
  
    Some parts are missing and will possibly be expanded beyond that at a later stage

  * Chapter 3: Editing Lisp (Early draft)
  
    Many sections are TBW, some parts might get rewritten. Additionally I'll eventually cover the Atom editor.

* Part II
  * Chapter 4: Caveman2 (Early draft)
  
    Very early draft, possibly subject to a complete rewrite. Many missing parts.

## What remains to be written

Current plans include:

* A chapter walking the reader through developing a simple wiki app

  Will include detailed information on Caveman2's features, including a detailed Djula tutorial, more Envy examples, and an introduction to it's DB layer.

* A chapter on alternatives

  Caveman uses Djula for templating and datafly/sxql for DB access. We'll introduce alternatives, such as s-expression based HTML generation and various database libraries

* A basic Ironclad tutorial

  Introduction to ironclad and how to properly store passwords, API keys, ect.

* A chapter on frontend tools.

  Tools to help with CSS and writing JavaScript such as paredit
  
* A chapter on deployment

  From a simple Nginx setup to using docker with common lisp

## Additional ideas

I have some other ideas that might not make it into the book, such as:

* A chapter on Restful services
* Building desktop apps in a webview
* Packaging executables

If you have other ideas and they seem like they might be in the scope of the book, I'd love to hear from you!

## Release Party!

So we're finally here. I've been working towards this on and off since September and I couldn't be more exited. Based on feedback from interested readers, I've set up the minimum price at 20 USD, and a recommended price of 25 USD. But since this is a release party, I've used Lenpub's coupon feature. Until next Sunday(April 17) you can get the book for $15 if you follow [this link](http://leanpub.com/fullstacklisp/c/releaseparty). You can also read the book [online for free](https://leanpub.com/fullstacklisp/read) of course. And as with all Leanpub books, you can ask for your money back at any time for the first 45 days of your purchase. 

I also set up a new [twitter account](https://twitter.com/fullstacklisp) for the book. I mostly tweet while I write or research, but any important announcements will be pinned to the profile page.

## Going forward

I'll try to stick to a semi-regular update schedule. There's a lot of work ahead, but fortunately I have the opportunity to focus on the book more than last year. I'm still hesitant to commit to a rigorous schedule, but my original estimate from November was that it would be more or less done sometime this summer, that estimate seems very possible right now. I'll try to keep to a regular update schedule on this blog though. Next update will be sometime next week. For now, enjoy the release party, I know I will :)
